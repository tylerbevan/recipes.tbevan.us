Ingredients
************
 * 4 large chicken breasts (cooked and chopped)
 * 1/8 cup red curry paste
 * 3 tbsp sesame oil
 * 3 large garlic cloves, diced
 * 2 tbsp gresh ginger, grated fine
 * 1 large sweet onion, diced
 * 1 red bell pepper, diced
 * 1 poblano pepper, diced
 * 2 zucchini, chopped

 * 8 ounce chicken stock
 * 12 ounce natural peanut butter
 * 2 tsp salt
 * crushed peanuts for garnish
 * diced cilantro for garnish
 * 4 cups cooked rice.

Instructions
*************
Heat sesame oil and curry paste in sauce pot over medium heat until curry paste and
sesame oil have mixed and curry paste has broken down. Add onion and garlic to pot and simmer
until onion starts to turn clear. Add coconut milk, peanut butter, ginger, and chicken stock
to the pot. Bring to a simmer and reduce heat to low. Salt to taste; I like it on the
salty side because the veggies will offset the salt.

Combine peppers, zucchini, and 1/4 cup water in microwave safe bowl and steam in microwave until
just cooked. Add chicken and vegetables to a large stock pot. Ladle peanut sauce into pot
until all chicken and veggies are covered in sauce. Extra peanut sauce can be kept
refrigerated.

Serve with a scoop of rice and garnish with peanuts and cilantro. Enjoy!

Notes
------
The ratio of curry paste to coconut milk to peanut butter can be adjusted to taste.
Also if you don't want it as spicy, you can replace the curry paste with 1 tbsp each cumin and
coriander with 2 tsp each of tumeric and paprika. Add cayanne to your preferred level of heat.
