:summary: Butterscotch Pecan Pan Cookie

***********
Ingredients
***********
 * 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
 * 1 1/2 cups firmly packed light brown sugar
 * 1 cup granulated sugar
 * 3 large eggs
 * 2 teaspoons real vanilla extract
 * 3 cups all-purpose flour
 * 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
 * 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
 * 1 (11-ounce) package butterscotch morsels
 * 1 cup chopped pecans

************
Instructions
************
Preheat oven to 350Â°.
In a large bowl, beat butter and sugars with a mixer at high speed until
fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes, stopping occasionally to scrape sides of bowl.
Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla

In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt. With mixer
on low, gradually add flour mixture to butter mixture, beating just until
combined. Stir in butterscotch and pecans. Spread in 12" skillet.

Bake for 40 minutes, cover with foil, and bake 15 more minutes. Let cool for 30 minutes before slicing.

Notes
-----
Tip: Walnuts or peanuts can be used instead of pecans, and chocolate or peanut
butter morsels can be swapped for butterscotch. Mix and match to find your
favorite flavor combinations.
