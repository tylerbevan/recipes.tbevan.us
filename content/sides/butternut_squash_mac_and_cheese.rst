:summary: Butternut Squash Mac and Cheese

************
Ingredients
************
 * 2 1/2 - 3 lb butternut squash, cubed to 1"
 * 2 teaspoon olive oil
 * 3/4 teaspoons kosher salt, divided
 * 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, divided
 * 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
 * 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
 * 2 1/2 cups whole milk
 * 1/4 teaspoon ground mustard
 * 1/4 teaspoon Worchestershire sauce
 * 2 cups grated Cheddar cheese
 * 1 cup grated Gouda cheese
 * 1 cup grated Brie cheese
 * 6 slices bacon, cooked and diced
 * 8 ounces dry penne pasta, cooked per box directions
 * 16 Ritz crackers, crushed

Instructions
*************
Preheat oven to 425°.
In a rimmed baking sheet, stir together squash, oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 
1/4 teaspoon pepper.
Bake until tender, 20-25 minutes. Set aside. Reduce oven to 400°.

In a 12-inch cast-iron skillet, melt butter over medium-high heat.
Add flour to skillet, whisking to combine. Cook, whisking constantly, 
about 1 minute or until flour scent turns nutty. Gradually add milk, remaining 
salt, pepper, mustard, and Worchestershire, whisking until smooth. Cook,
stirring frequently, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Congrats! You made
a bechamel sauce, which is the base of all good creamy sauces. 

**Reduce heat to low**.
Add cheese **slowly**, while reserving 1/2 cup of the cheddar, stirring until 
consistent. Add bacon (and chives if desired). Remove from heat.
Add cooked pasta, and roasted squash, stirring gently to combine. 
Sprinkle with remaining cheese and then top with the crushed crackers.

Bake until cheese melts and top is golden brown, about 10 minutes.
Allow to rest at least 10 minutes before serving.

Tips
*****
If you want an even more earthy flavor, add sage, terragon, or rosemary
along with the milk and spices. For more kick, add red pepper or chili
powder. *Don't use pre-shredded cheese.* The additive that keeps it from
sticking together prevents the sauce from forming correctly. Always buy
blocks and shred it yourself when making cheese sauces.

The most important thing is to not get the sauce too hot or
add the cheese too fast. Either way can cause the sauce to go grainy
and oily. It still tastes good, but not as smooth and creamy.
