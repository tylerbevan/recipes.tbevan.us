Instructions
*************
  Preheat oven to 425°. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
  In a medium bowl, stir together squash, oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 
  1/4 teaspoon pepper. Place squash in a single layer on prepared pan.
  Bake until tender, about 30 minutes. Set aside. Increase oven to 450°.
  In a 10-inch cast-iron skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Add sage
  leaves; cook until crisp, about 1 minute. Using a slotted spoon, remove
  sage. Chop, and set aside.
  
  Add flour to skillet, whisking to combine. Cook, whisking constantly, 
  about 1 minute. Add milk, remaining 1 3/4 teaspoons salt, remaining 1/4
  teaspoon pepper, and nutmeg, whisking until smooth. Cook, stirring
  frequently, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low.
  
  Add cheese slowly, while reserving 1/4 cup total, stirring until melted.
  Add fried sage, fresh sage, cooked pasta, and roasted squash, stirring
  gently to combine. Remove from heat. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup 
  cheese and then panko.
  
  Bake until cheese melts and top is golden brown, about 8 minutes.
  Garnish with sage and pepper, if desired.
