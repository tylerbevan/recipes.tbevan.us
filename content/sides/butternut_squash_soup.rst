Instructions
*************
  In a large Dutch oven, melt butter over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook 
  until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook 1 minute. Stir in carrot
  and celery; cook 5 minutes more. Add squash, broth, apple, thyme, salt,
  curry, and pepper; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, and simmer until
  vegetables are tender, about 25 minutes.
  
  Remove and discard thyme. Working in batches, transfer vegetables to the
  container of a blender using a slotted spoon; purée until smooth. Reserve 1
  cup broth. Return puréed vegetables and reserved broth to pot; reheat over
  medium heat. Garnish with thyme and cream, if desired.
